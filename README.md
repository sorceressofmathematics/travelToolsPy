# travelToolsPy
Python implementation of travel tools as imagneered by Bredan, Brent, and Tim

So I will write this up somewhere in formal requirements.
but basically what we need
is something that allows us to put in the dates and cities of a trip. and then the application will let us know the farms from our dataset that are on the way in between the trip destinations
so I have 2 trips planned
that you can use as your test set

it should spit out all data about the about the farm from dataset 1 and the travel cities and dates are listed in schedule tab highlight in yellow

How big a deviation from the google expected travel route is acceptable?
and there is actually a maps link that should show the trips. I would say it should be adjustable but lets go with 10 km and 25 km for testing

Datasets are located in the LSL external folder on drive

DO NOT CHECK IN DATASETS
